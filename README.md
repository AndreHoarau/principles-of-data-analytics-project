# Princinples of Data Analytics Project: Palmer Penguins Data Set
## Lecturer: Ian McLoughlin (ian.mcloughlin@atu.ie)
**By Andre Hoarau**

Project Aim: This project aims to investigate the [Palmer Penguins Data Set](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/). Within this repository, you will find a Jupyter Notebook that analyzes the dataset using the Python programming language to perform statistical analysis and visualize the results. The project demonstrates evidence of my research beyond this course while replicating a real-world work scenario where a data analyst presents their findings to non-technical leaders. Additionally, the project explores the limitations of the analysis and emphasizes their importance.

## Technologies
* Python 3.11.5 available [here](https://www.anaconda.com/download)
* Visual Studio Code available [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* Note: Installation instructions are included at both addresses.
